## Overview

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project provides both encryption and decryption functionalities, with a simple web interface for user interaction.

## Features

- Caesar Cipher Encryption
- Caesar Cipher Decryption
- Web interface for user input and visualization

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main files:
- `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`: Web page files for the user interface.

## Usage

1. The web page (`index.html`) allows users to enter a message, specify the shift value, and perform encryption or decryption.

## How to Run Locally

To run the web page locally:
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
